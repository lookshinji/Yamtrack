## 🐳 Installing with Docker

Copy the default `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository and set the environment variables. This would use a SQlite database, which is enough for most use cases.

The Docker image can be used with or without a tag:
- `ghcr.io/dannyvfilms/yamtrack` (defaults to `:latest`)
- `ghcr.io/dannyvfilms/yamtrack:latest` (explicit latest tag)
- `ghcr.io/dannyvfilms/yamtrack:release` (explicit release tag)

To start the containers run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Alternatively, if you need a PostgreSQL database, you can use the `docker-compose.postgres.yml` file.

### 🌊 Reverse Proxy Setup

When using a reverse proxy, if you see a `403 - Forbidden` error, you need to set the `URLS` environment variable to the URL you are using for the app.

```bash
services:
  yamtrack:
    ...
    environment:
      - URLS=https://yamtrack.mydomain.com
    ...
```

Note that the setting must include the correct protocol (`https` or `http`), and must not include the application `/` context path. Multiple origins can be specified by separating them with a comma (`,`).

### ⚙️ Environment variables

For detailed information on environment variables, please refer to the [Environment Variables wiki page](https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/Yamtrack/wiki/Environment-Variables).

## 💻 Local development

Clone the repository and change directory to it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FuzzyGrim/Yamtrack.git
cd Yamtrack
```

Install Redis or spin up a bare redis container:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 --restart unless-stopped redis:8-alpine
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables.

```bash
TMDB_API=API_KEY
MAL_API=API_KEY
IGDB_ID=IGDB_ID
IGDB_SECRET=IGDB_SECRET
STEAM_API_KEY=STEAM_API_SECRET
SECRET=SECRET
DEBUG=True
```

Then run the following commands.

```bash
python -m pip install -U -r requirements-dev.txt
cd src
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver & celery -A config worker --beat --scheduler django --loglevel DEBUG & tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/tailwind.css --watch
```

Go to: http://localhost:8000
