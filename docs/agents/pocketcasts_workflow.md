# Pocket Casts Workflow

This document captures the end-to-end Pocket Casts workflow in Yamtrack: connection, import, recurring sync, data modeling, UI surfaces, and the duplicate-handling logic. It is intentionally detailed around recurring sync and duplicate creation.

## Scope and entry points
- **Connection + scheduling UI**: `src/integrations/views.py` (`pocketcasts_connect`, `import_pocketcasts`, `pocketcasts_disconnect`) and `src/templates/users/import_data.html`.
- **Account state**: `src/integrations/models.py` (`PocketCastsAccount`).
- **Import pipeline**: `src/integrations/imports/pocketcasts.py` (`PocketCastsImporter`).
- **Recurring task**: `src/integrations/tasks.py` (`import_pocketcasts_history`).
- **RSS episode refresh**: `src/events/tasks.py` (`refresh_podcast_episodes`).
- **Podcast models**: `src/app/models.py` (`PodcastShow`, `PodcastEpisode`, `Podcast`, `PodcastShowTracker`).
- **Podcast UI**: `src/app/views.py` (`media_details` for pocketcasts, `podcast_show_detail`, `podcast_save`, `podcast_mark_all_played`) plus list adapters.
- **External sources**: `src/integrations/pocketcasts_api.py`, `src/integrations/podcast_rss.py`, `src/integrations/pocketcasts_artwork.py`, and `src/app/providers/pocketcasts.py` (iTunes search/lookup).

## Data model (podcasts)
- **PodcastShow**: container for show metadata; unique on `podcast_uuid`. Fields include `title`, `author`, `image`, `description`, `rss_feed_url`, `genres`, `language`.
- **PodcastEpisode**: container for episode metadata; unique on `episode_uuid`. Contains `show`, `title`, `published`, `duration`, `audio_url`, `episode_number`, `season_number`, `is_deleted`.
- **Podcast (Media subclass)**: per-user tracking record for a specific episode. Holds `item`, `show`, `episode`, `status`, `progress`, `played_up_to_seconds`, `last_seen_status`, `end_date`. Multiple Podcast rows per episode are allowed to represent multiple plays.
- **PodcastShowTracker**: per-user tracking for a show (status/score/dates/notes), similar to ArtistTracker.
- **Item**: the generic media identity. For podcasts, `Item.media_id` is the episode UUID for episode tracking, or the show UUID when building list adapters.

## External APIs and data sources
- **Pocket Casts API** (`src/integrations/pocketcasts_api.py` and `src/integrations/imports/pocketcasts.py`):
  - `POST /user/login` for credentials login (returns access/refresh tokens).
  - `POST /user/refresh` for token refresh.
  - `POST /user/history` returns the last 100 history entries (no pagination).
  - `POST /user/podcast/list` returns show metadata (descriptions, titles, authors).
  - `GET /discover/images/{size}/{podcast_uuid}.jpg` for authenticated artwork (used as fallback).
- **RSS feeds** (`src/integrations/podcast_rss.py`): public RSS/Atom parsing for full episode lists and metadata.
- **Artwork fallback** (`src/integrations/pocketcasts_artwork.py`): prefers RSS feed artwork, then iTunes search; Pocket Casts images require auth.
- **iTunes search/lookup** (`src/app/providers/pocketcasts.py`): used for search results and for show enrichment when the app only has an iTunes ID.

## Connection and credential storage
- **Connect flow** (`pocketcasts_connect` in `src/integrations/views.py`):
  - Requires email + password (for Apple/Google accounts, user must set a password first).
  - Calls `pocketcasts_api.login`, stores encrypted credentials and tokens.
  - Parses JWT expiration via `parse_token_expiration`.
  - Clears `connection_broken` on success.
  - Creates a 2-hour Celery beat schedule if it does not exist.
  - Immediately enqueues an initial import (`tasks.import_pocketcasts.delay`).
- **Disconnect flow** (`pocketcasts_disconnect`):
  - Deletes the periodic task.
  - Deletes the `PocketCastsAccount` row (full disconnect).
- **Account state** (`PocketCastsAccount` in `src/integrations/models.py`):
  - `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `email`, `password` stored encrypted.
  - `token_expires_at`, `last_sync_at`, `connection_broken` tracked.
  - `is_connected` uses credentials or tokens; `connection_broken` only blocks if no credentials.
  - `is_token_expired` compares `token_expires_at` with now.

## Scheduling and recurring sync
- **Recurring task**: `Import from Pocket Casts (Recurring)` in `src/integrations/tasks.py`.
  - Scheduled via `django_celery_beat` for every 2 hours (minute 0, hour */2).
  - The scheduled task (`import_pocketcasts_history`) enqueues the actual import (`import_pocketcasts.delay`), so two tasks are involved.
- **Manual import**: `import_pocketcasts` view queues an import and also sets up the recurring schedule if missing.
- **Mode**: Pocket Casts imports always run with `mode="new"` (no overwrite workflow).
- **No global lock**: there is no shared lock around imports. Concurrent manual + recurring runs can overlap.

## Import pipeline (PocketCastsImporter.import_data)
Step-by-step behavior in `src/integrations/imports/pocketcasts.py`:
1. **Ensure token**: `_ensure_valid_token` prefers login with credentials; falls back to refresh token. Sets `connection_broken` on failures, can delete schedule via `_disconnect_account`.
2. **Fetch show metadata**: `pocketcasts_api.get_podcast_list` populates `self.podcast_metadata` (descriptions, titles, authors).
3. **Fetch history**: `_fetch_history` calls `/user/history` (last 100 entries only).
4. **First import check**: `is_first_import = not Podcast.objects.filter(user=self.user).exists()`.
5. **First pass episode processing**:
   - For each history entry: call `_process_episode`.
   - If the episode is new and this is not the first import, defer completion date inference and collect into `new_completed_podcasts` if it looks completed.
6. **Completion date inference (recurring sync)**:
   - Sync window: `last_sync_at` to now (defaults to now - 2 hours if none).
   - Uses `_get_history_items_in_range` to build a timeline of completed items (podcast, music, episodes, movies).
   - `_infer_completion_date` attempts to place completion times without overlapping scrobbled items, sequences new podcasts by published date, and clamps to sync window.
7. **Bulk create / cleanup**:
   - `helpers.cleanup_existing_media` (only relevant in overwrite mode).
   - `helpers.bulk_create_media` for new Podcast entries (bulk create with history).
   - Records pending history for new entries after bulk create (`_pending_history`).
8. **RSS sync for processed shows**:
   - `_sync_episodes_from_rss` runs for any show with `rss_feed_url`.
9. **Update last sync**: `PocketCastsAccount.last_sync_at = now`.
10. **Duplicate cleanup**: `_cleanup_duplicate_episodes` runs the global merge routine.
11. **Cache refresh**: triggers history + statistics cache refresh if any podcasts were imported.

## Episode processing details (_process_episode)
### Show creation and metadata
- `PodcastShow` is created from Pocket Casts data when missing.
- Title/author/description are updated from history or `/user/podcast/list`.
- RSS feed discovery:
  - Uses metadata fields (`rssUrl`, `feedUrl`) if present.
  - Falls back to iTunes lookup via `pocketcasts_artwork.fetch_podcast_artwork_and_rss`.
  - Stores `rss_feed_url` on the show.
- Artwork handling:
  - Pocket Casts image URLs require auth, so they are treated as temporary.
  - If no public artwork, attempts RSS + iTunes (cached).
  - Falls back to Pocket Casts URL if no alternatives.
- Ensures a `PodcastShowTracker` exists for the user.

### Episode creation and merging
- First attempts to find a `PodcastEpisode` by `episode_uuid` (Pocket Casts UUID).
- If not found, tries **title + published date** within the same show:
  - If matched and the existing episode already has the Pocket Casts UUID elsewhere, it merges:
    - Moves `Podcast` rows to the Pocket Casts UUID episode.
    - Moves `Item` references to the Pocket Casts UUID item.
    - Deletes the duplicate episode and item.
  - Otherwise, updates the matched episode UUID to the Pocket Casts UUID.
- If still not found, creates a new `PodcastEpisode`.
- Updates episode fields: duration, published, audio_url, is_deleted.

### Item creation
- Creates/updates `Item` with `media_id=episode_uuid`, `source=pocketcasts`, `media_type=podcast`.
- Stores `runtime_minutes` and `release_datetime` from episode data.

### Podcast (per-user) creation/update
- Looks up existing Podcast via:
  - `self.existing_podcasts[(episode_uuid, pocketcasts)]`, built at importer init.
  - Fallback: `Podcast.objects.filter(item=item, user=user).order_by("-created_at").first()`.
- If existing Podcast is completed with an end_date, processing is skipped.
- Progress/status calculation:
  - Uses `playingStatus` and `playedUpTo`.
  - Requires significant progress (> 60s or > 10% of duration) to mark completed.
  - Tracks `played_up_to_seconds` and `last_seen_status` for UI.
- Completion date:
  - First import: published + duration (or published if no duration).
  - Recurring sync: inferred later if new; or derived from last in-progress record.
- History recording:
  - For existing entries, `_record_history` updates progress to create historical entries.
  - Skips duplicate history if end_date is within 5 minutes of latest history.

## Completion date inference (recurring sync)
- Inference uses the sync window, existing history (podcasts + scrobbled items), and ordering by published date.
- If there is a last in-progress record, it uses remaining time from that progress.
- Avoids overlapping with precise history items (music/TV episodes).
- Clamps completion times to the sync window bounds.

## RSS episode sync
There are two RSS-driven sync paths:
- **Per-import**: `_sync_episodes_from_rss` in `PocketCastsImporter`.
  - Fetches all RSS episodes for processed shows.
  - Matches by GUID or title + published date.
  - Updates metadata or creates missing episodes.
  - Preserves Pocket Casts UUIDs when they look like UUIDs (36 chars + 4 hyphens).
- **Global refresh**: `events.tasks.refresh_podcast_episodes`.
  - Runs for all shows with `rss_feed_url` (triggered from `reload_calendar` when called without a specific user).
  - Same match logic and updates.
  - Runs `_cleanup_duplicate_episodes_global` after refresh.

## UI surfaces and manual actions
- **Media list**: shows `PodcastShowTracker` entries in place of individual episodes (`media_list` adapter in `src/app/views.py`).
- **Show detail**:
  - `media_details` routes to show view for `source=pocketcasts` + `media_type=podcast`.
  - If `media_id` is numeric, treats it as an iTunes ID and creates a show with `podcast_uuid="itunes:{id}"`, then fetches episodes from RSS.
  - Ensures full RSS episode list for the show when loading detail.
  - Uses `podcast_episodes_api` for infinite scroll.
- **Track modal**:
  - Show tracker uses `PodcastShowTrackerForm`.
  - Episode play tracking uses `podcast_save`.
- **Manual play** (`podcast_save`):
  - Creates/updates a `Podcast` row and writes history by updating `end_date`.
  - Avoids duplicate history when end_date is within 5 minutes of the last entry.
- **Mark all played** (`podcast_mark_all_played`):
  - Optionally refreshes episodes from RSS first.
  - Creates a `Podcast` entry for every unplayed episode.

## Duplicate creation and recurring sync (deep dive)
This is the critical area for recurring sync issues.

### Where duplicates can be created
- **History returns duplicates within a single import**:
  - `/user/history` can include the same episode multiple times.
  - New episodes added to `bulk_media` are not added to `self.existing_podcasts` during the same run.
  - Result: multiple `Podcast` rows for the same episode can be created in the same import pass (before bulk create hits the DB).
- **Concurrent imports**:
  - The recurring task enqueues the real import task (`import_pocketcasts_history` -> `import_pocketcasts.delay`).
  - If a new scheduled run fires before the previous import finishes, two imports can run in parallel.
  - There is no global lock in `import_media`, so both imports can create overlapping Podcast rows.
- **Episode UUID mismatches between Pocket Casts and RSS**:
  - RSS GUIDs often differ from Pocket Casts UUIDs.
  - If title or published date is missing/mismatched, the title+date fallback cannot match, so a second `PodcastEpisode` is created.
  - The episode-level unique constraint is only on UUID, so duplicates with different UUIDs are allowed.
- **Show duplication from iTunes enrichment**:
  - Shows created from iTunes use `podcast_uuid="itunes:{id}"`.
  - Pocket Casts imports use the Pocket Casts UUID.
  - Same real-world show can exist twice at the show level; episodes may be duplicated as a result.
- **Existing Podcast row ambiguity**:
  - `self.existing_podcasts` is built once and can only hold one Podcast per episode UUID.
  - If multiple Podcast rows already exist (multiple plays), the dict keeps only one (unordered).
  - The importer may update a non-completed row and create a new completion even when another completed row already exists.
- **RSS refresh timing**:
  - Every import triggers `events.tasks.reload_calendar.delay()`, which runs a global RSS refresh.
  - RSS refresh can update or create episodes while an import is processing, leading to mismatched UUIDs and duplicate episodes.

### Current defenses against duplicates
- **Early exit for completed episodes**: if an existing Podcast row is completed with `end_date`, `_process_episode` returns early.
- **In-import dedupe**: history entries are deduped by episode UUID, preferring completed entries and any available event timestamp.
- **Fallback lookup by Item**: if UUID lookup fails, the importer tries `Podcast.objects.filter(item=item, user=user)`.
- **Existing completed guard**: before creating a new Podcast row, it checks for any completed Podcast for the same Item.
- **Duplicate completion guard**: if Pocket Casts repeats a completed entry with the same progress/duration, the importer skips creating a new play row.
- **Episode merge logic**: if a title+date match exists but another episode has the Pocket Casts UUID, it merges and deletes the duplicate.
- **Global cleanup**: `_cleanup_duplicate_episodes_global` merges episodes when (show, normalized title, published date) match and prefers Pocket Casts UUIDs.
- **History dedupe**: `_record_history` skips entries when `end_date` is within 5 minutes of the last history entry.

### Gaps to watch during recurring sync
- **No in-memory dedupe for new episodes**: the bulk list can contain repeated Podcast entries if history repeats an episode.
- **Title/date matching is fragile**: missing `published` dates or minor title changes prevent merges.
- **UUID churn from RSS**: episodes created from RSS with a hash GUID cannot be matched later without title/date; they remain as parallel episodes.
- **Concurrent imports are not serialized**: recurring + manual imports can overlap.

## Cache refresh
- When podcasts are imported, `schedule_history_refresh` and `statistics_cache.schedule_all_ranges_refresh` are called to keep history and stats caches fresh.
